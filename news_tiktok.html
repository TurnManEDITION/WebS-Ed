			<h2 class="text-content">PARIS, March 29 - News. The municipality of Amsterdam, following the government of the Netherlands, intends to ban the TikTok application on the work phones of civil servants, Telegram may be next under the ban, writes NL Times, citing a member of the municipality.</h2>
			<h2 class="text-content">Amsterdam municipality member Turia Meliani said in a letter to the city council that the city wants to ban the use of TikTok on civil servants' work mobile phones. Thus, the municipality decided to follow the example of the Cabinet of Ministers of the country.</h2>
			<h2 class="text-content">By refusing such applications, Amsterdam wants to prevent a "potential security risk" of personal data, she said. City officials do not rule out a ban on other apps such as Telegram soon.</h2>
			<h2 class="text-content">City leaders will now instruct city council members to "delete the app as soon as possible" and will also remove TikTok from their phones, the letter says.</h2>
			<h2 class="text-content">Earlier it became known that the authorities of the Netherlands will soon ban civil servants from installing the TikTok application on work mobile phones, as, in their opinion, it can be used for espionage. As noted in the government, officials are advised not to use the applications of companies from Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, since these countries allegedly have an "aggressive cyber program."</h2>
