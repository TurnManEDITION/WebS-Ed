				<h2 class="text-content">Elon Musk himself was directly involved in the development of the Tesla Phone and, of course, the smartphone has some unique features. A solar panel is located at the back of the phone, which allows you to charge the device by 20% in 30 minutes under the sun. So, for example, while traveling far away from civilization, not being able to charge the phone, you can always be in touch by simply exposing the phone to the sun's rays. None of the existing flagships can boast of such an opportunity.</h2>

Tesla Phone has the ability to connect directly to this network and use high-speed satellite Internet from anywhere in the world. At the same time, for smartphone buyers, this network will be available free of charge and without time limits.</h2>
				<h2 class="text-content">The full presentation of Tesla Phone will take place later, and the start of sales is expected towards the end of 2022. How much Elon Musk will evaluate his revolutionary novelty is not yet known.</h2>
